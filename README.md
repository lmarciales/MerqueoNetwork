# MerqueoNetwork

## Description

Merqueo Network is a Frontend Test Project and its goal is to design a web platform where the user can publish new status, see all the status published and comment each post. Also, each user can react to any post only once per post. The following are some details implemented:

**Each user should be able to:**

+ Post a new status.
+ See all posts.
+ React to any post.
+ Comment to any post.

**Each post should have:**

+ The name of the user who posted it.
+ The time that has passed since it was published.
+ The options to react/comment
+ Show how many users have reacted to the post.
+ Show how many comments have the post.
+ Show the post comments.
+ An input to add a new comment.

**Each comment should have:**

+ The name of the user who commented it.
+ The time that has passed since it was commented.

## Use

The application is deployed at [https://merqueo-network.netlify.com](https://merqueo-network.netlify.com/). There you can test the result right now.

The application is mean to be only front functionality, so there's not persistence of the data.

Once the page is loaded, you will see only the field to post a new status. Once you insert anything there, and clicked in the button, you will see the post created immediately. In fact, you can see the time passed since you created the post.

Now that you created a post (or some posts), you can try to give a reaction to the post. Since this feature isn't well defined, the way it works is that once you click the reaction button, you will count up the reactions counter, and see a circle with the user initials.

The next option is to comment, so when you click the comment button, you will see now and input where you can put your comment.

## More about the project development

### Trello

The management of this project was done using Trello Boards. With this board, all the tasks planned to do where listed, starting in a Backlog list. There are also two more lists, and they are about the tasks that are currently being working, and the Done list, where the tasks are already completed. Most of the tasks have their own complete description, and some screens and evidences of the work.

### Gitflow

The control version of this project was based in a Gitflow base, where the following branches were created:

+ master: main branch, and the only one where the code is deployed to the hosting.
+ test: development done, ready for testing.
+ develop: main development branch.
  + feature/{feature-name}: specific branch for a feature to implement.

Also, each integration was done using Pull Request to the "parent" branch.

### Development

The implementation was done using Vue.js as a challenge to work with this framework/library. Even if this was a Test, I took advantage of this project to challenge myself and learn a lot of new stuff. 

Saying this, with the same idea, frameworks css like Bootstrap wasn't implemented in this project. The reason is, even if the project wasn't large, I wanted to try another approach using CSS Grid + Flexbox.
